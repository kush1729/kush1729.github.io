I'm a first year PhD student in the Harvard math department. My advisor is [Mark Kisin](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~kisin/). I'm interested in algebraic number theory; specifically, I'm interested in the intersection of arithmetic geometry and (automorphic) representation theory. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).

Outside of mathematics, I like to fold origami. If you're interested in origami and are in or around Cambridge, do check out [OrigaMIT](http://origamit.mit.edu/)!
