description: Random study notes I've made. I do not vouch for their accuracy, though of course I am trying my best to be correct. Most of these notes are, in some sense, "cheat sheets", i.e. I mostly use them for quick reference for certain facts/results, and if I need more, I follow up on the references cited.
