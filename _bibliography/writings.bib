      abstract = {Some notes I made while studying for Harvard's qualifying exam, held in the last week of August 2022. I did not put much effort into the chapters on algebra and the complex analysis, as I felt extremely comfortable with them. In particular, in the complex analysis chapter, I also barely put any effort into the section on conformal maps, which (as it turns out) was a bad idea. I also did not study for algebraic topology for the quals, and so there is no chapter on algebraic topology. With these caveats out of the way, I think (and have been told) that the notes are fairly good for preparing for the other five subjects on the Harvard quals.},

In particular, I am looking at (relative) de Rham cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves on arbitrary schemes and the theory of connections on such sheaves. In particular, I will probably focus on three things: (1) connections in positive characteristic, (2) canonical extensions of connections and bundles over divisors, and (3) (abelian and non-abelian) Hodge theory. These notes are partly motivated by the seminar on non-abelian Hodge theory running at Harvard. These notes are incomplete.},
