      year={2022},
      abstract = {Some notes I made while studying for Harvard's qualifying exam, held in the last week of August 2022. I did not put much effort into the chapters on algebra and the complex analysis, as I felt extremely comfortable with them. In particular, in the complex analysis chapter, I also barely put any effort into the section on conformal maps, which (as it turns out) was a bad idea. I also did not study for algebraic topology for the quals, and so there is no chapter on algebraic topology. With these caveats out of the way, I think (and have been told) that the notes are fairly good for preparing for the other five subjects on the Harvard quals.},
