In this tutorial, we will study the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms in a down-to-earth and self-contained manner. Secretly, this tutorial is meant to be an introduction to some of the techniques of modern number theory. The hope is to show what algebraic number theory looks like outside of the typical undergraduate course.

This tutorial is roughly split into two parts. For the first part, we will look at the classification problem of quadratic forms over number fields, p-adic fields, and their rings of integers. The big theorems that we will prove (from scratch) are the Hasse-Minkowski theorem (an instance of the very general local-to-global philosophy pervading all of modern number theory), and the full classification of arithmetic lattices. For the second part, we will build up to a statement of the Siegel-Weil mass formula and its applications. For the most part, we will be solely working over \(\mathbb{Q}\) and its quadratic extensions.

## Course Notes

I will be writing my own course notes, which I will make available here.

There will also be weekly problem sets, which are NOT required. The problem sets are just exercises for those who are interested in becoming more comfortable with the topic. There will also be some extra results/theorems in the problem sets which I feel are interesting exercises or that I just didn't have time to prove in class.
